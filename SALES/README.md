# Sales taxes problem
## How I develop

I have written the following code using Visual Studio 2022 and using 
Windows Forms App (.NET Framework 4.8).

## How to launch the software

1. Download the repository on your device.
2. Once the repository has been downloaded, open the directory "Greenext\SALES\SALES\SALES\bin\Release"
3. Execute "SALES.exe"
4. In front of you will be able to find two spaces, 
one indicating the input and the other the output, with the button "CALCULATE SALES TAXES" at the bottom of the window.
5. Write in the input section your shopping basket using the format:  
```[quantity] [imported?] [object] [price]```  
You can add more than one row. Then press the button "CALCULATE SALES TAXES".

**IMPORTANT:** Note that if you need any help or instructions while using the application you can find 
two buttons with "?" that will assist you through the usage.
